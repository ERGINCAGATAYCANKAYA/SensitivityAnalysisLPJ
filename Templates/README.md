# Templates 

This folder contains the templates to rerun the simulations for the individual settings.\
**mastersheet.rds**: A table containing the information on which site is used and which species is simulated\
**submit_template.sh**: Shell script for running the monocluture R_scripts on a clutser (ATHOS), other clusters may require different shell scripts\
**submit_template_mixed.sh**: Shell script for running the mixed R_scripts on a clutser (ATHOS), other clusters may require different shell scripts\
**template_Fag_syl.R**: Template R script which contains the setting and the code to run the Fagus sylvatica simulations\
**template_Pic_abi.R**: Template R script which contains the setting and the code to run the Pices abies simulations\
**template_Pin_syl.R**: Template R script which contains the setting and the code to run the Pinus sylvestris simulations\
**template_mixed.R**:Template R script which contains the setting and the code to run the mixed simulations\
**white_parameters_mixed.rds**: Uniform parameters sampled and used to generate the run parameters knowing the range for the mixed simulations </br>
**white_parameters_mono.rds**: Uniform parameters sampled and used to generate the run parameters knowing the range for the monoculture simulations
